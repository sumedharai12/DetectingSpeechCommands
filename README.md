# Detecting Speech Commands
Speech recognition has become an important task in the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. In our project, we explore one important task with speech recognition - speech commands detection. We conduct feature engineering by converting raw waveform to Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which we use as inputs to our models. We experiment with several different algorithms such as Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture, Convolutional Neural Networks and variants of Recurrent Neural Networks including Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit. In our experiment, RNN with BiLSTM and Attention achieves the best performance with an accuracy of 93.6 \%.
